CentOS: 
vm 1 : server 
Add two Network adapter NAT and one is Host-Only

stop firewall
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl status firewalld
---
vm2 : client

stop firewall
Add  Network adapter only NAT

------------------
in vm software (for overall vms if not done)
edit => virtual network editor 
check dhcp is enabled
---------------------------

vm1 :

$ cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
$ sed -i 's/mirrorlist/#mirrorlist/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
$ sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
$ cd
$ yum install git -y


a) Create a internal web server:

$ yum install httpd -y

b) Open config:

$ nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
search for (below line)
        Listen 192.168.254.137:80
               (current host-only_ip:80) 
               save it
               if ip not found do (dhclient -r and dhclient and ip a)
               
               (also do this )in vm software (for overall vms if not done)
                edit => virtual network editor 
                check dhcp is enabled

Welcome to the OpenVPN installer!
The git repository is available at: https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install

I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup.
You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them.

I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN listening to.
Unless your server is behind NAT, it should be your public IPv4 address.
IP address: 192.168.254.137   (host-only ip)
****put ip of 1st vm

enter
----------------
It seems this server is behind NAT. What is its public IPv4 address or hostname?
We need it for the clients to connect to the server.
Public IPv4 address or hostname: 192.168.206.133  (NAT  ip of 1st vm)

Checking for IPv6 connectivity...

Your host does not appear to have IPv6 connectivity.

Do you want to enable IPv6 support (NAT)? [y/n]: n

What port do you want OpenVPN to listen to?
   1) Default: 1194
   2) Custom
   3) Random [49152-65535]
Port choice [1-3]: 1

What protocol do you want OpenVPN to use?
UDP is faster. Unless it is not available, you shouldn't use TCP.
   1) UDP
   2) TCP
Protocol [1-2]: 1

What DNS resolvers do you want to use with the VPN?
   1) Current system resolvers (from /etc/resolv.conf)
   2) Self-hosted DNS Resolver (Unbound)
   3) Cloudflare (Anycast: worldwide)
   4) Quad9 (Anycast: worldwide)
   5) Quad9 uncensored (Anycast: worldwide)
   6) FDN (France)
   7) DNS.WATCH (Germany)
   8) OpenDNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   9) Google (Anycast: worldwide)

   12) NextDNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   13) Custom

Do you want to use compression? It is not recommended since the VORACLE attack makes use of it.
Enable compression? [y/n]: n


Do you want to customize encryption settings?
Unless you know what you're doing, you should stick with the default parameters provided by the script.
Note that whatever you choose, all the choices presented in the script are safe. (Unlike OpenVPN's defaults)
See https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install#security-and-encryption to learn more.

Customize encryption settings? [y/n]: n


Okay, that was all I needed. We are ready to setup your OpenVPN server now.
You will be able to generate a client at the end of the installation.
Press any key to continue...


Tell me a name for the client.
The name must consist of alphanumeric character. It may also include an underscore or a dash.
Client name: zoro

Do you want to protect the configuration file with a password?
(e.g. encrypt the private key with a password)
   1) Add a passwordless client
   2) Use a password for the client
Select an option [1-2]: 1

Client zoro added.

The configuration file has been written to /root/zoro.ovpn.
Download the .ovpn file and import it in your OpenVPN client.
